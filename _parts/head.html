<p>
  I am the senior privacy researcher at <a href="//brave.com">Brave
    Software</a>, where I work on new ways to improve privacy
  and security on the web, and to measure the risk of new threats
  to Brave browser users.
</p>

<p>
  Before joining Brave, I worked on my PhD in the <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/">Computer Science department
    at the University of Illinois at Chicago</a> in the <a href="https://bits.lab.uic.edu/">BITS Lab</a>,
  working under the kind and knowledgable guidance of <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~ckanich/">Chris Kanich</a>.

<p>
  I research web security and privacy, including browser hardening techniques and
  measuring how the growth of the Web API has impacted user privacy and security.
  I use this research to build access control systems for browser functionally
  and tools for deploying web applications that provide stronger
  privacy and security guarantees for users.
